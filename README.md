 # Objective
 The objective of the computer vision task described above is to develop and evaluate a machine learning model that can accurately solve a specific visual recognition 
 problem, such as image classification or object detection.

 # Key Activities of Computer Vision Task
 
**1. Data Collection and Annotation:**<br/>
Source datasets from public repositories (e.g., CIFAR-10, COCO, ImageNet) or collect your own through cameras, sensors, or web scraping.<br/>
Manually label or annotate images with categories (for classification) or bounding boxes/segmentation masks (for object detection or segmentation).<br/>

**2. Data Preprocessing and Augmentation:**<br/>
Resize images to a standard size, normalize pixel values, and convert color spaces if needed.<br/>
Increase the diversity of the training data by applying transformations like rotation, flipping, zooming, cropping, and color adjustments to make the model more robust.<br/>

**3. Model Selection**
For image classification, select models like Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs).<br/>
Leverage pre-trained models (e.g., ResNet, VGG, EfficientNet) on large datasets (like ImageNet) and fine-tune them for your specific task.<br/>

# Technologies used in Computer Vision Task

**Python:** The primary language used for developing computer vision models due to its simplicity and rich ecosystem of libraries.<br/>

**Libraries and Frameworks for Computer Vision**
**TensorFlow:** An open-source deep learning framework developed by Google, used for training and deploying deep learning models.<br/>

**PyTorch:**
Another deep learning framework, highly flexible and often used in research. It is particularly useful for developing complex models such as CNNs for image recognition.<br/>

**Scikit-learn:**
A machine learning library that can be used for evaluation metrics, data preprocessing, and some model building (though it's more suited for classical ML rather than deep learning).<br/>

# Data Handling and Preprocessing: Pandas, NumPy, Pillow<br/>
# Visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly<br/>
# Model Saving/Serialization: Joblib, Pickle<br/>
# Hyperparameter Tuning: Optuna, GridSearchCV<br/>
# Deployment (Optional): Flask, FastAPI, TensorFlow Lite, PyTorch Mobile<br/>
# Development Environment: Jupyter Notebooks.<br/>

# Key Concepts 

**1. Image Preprocessing:**
Adjusting the pixel values of images so they fall within a consistent range (e.g., between 0 and 1 or -1 and 1), which helps models train faster and perform better.<br/>

**2. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs):** A key layer in CNNs where the model applies filters (kernels) to the input image, detecting features like edges, textures, and patterns.<br/>

**3. Image Classification:** A task where the model assigns a single class label to each input image from a predefined set of categories.<br/>

**4. Visualization:** Graphs that plot the training and validation loss/accuracy over epochs to monitor model performance and detect overfitting or underfitting.
 A matrix to visualize model errors, showing the distribution of true positive, false positive, true negative, and false negative predictions.<br/>
